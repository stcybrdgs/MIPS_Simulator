MIPS Ops is a JavaScript web application that is meant to help MIPS newcomers to conceptualize the algorithms
that MIPS uses to accomplish certain functions. At the time of this writing, the application includes a simulation of
how MIPS handles integer multiplication. An additional simulation for integer division is currently in the works.
Other simulations may be incorporated thereafter.

This web project began as a **[C++ assignment](https://github.com/stcybrdgs/misclCpp/tree/master/mipsOps)** for a computer architecture class at Texas State University in San Marcos.

This web project uses JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
