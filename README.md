This web project is meant to assist MIPS newcomers in conceptualizing the operation algorithms that MIPS uses to accomplish certain functions. At the time of this writing, the module includes a simulation of how MIPS handles integer multiplication. An additional simulation for integer division is currently in the works and is scheduled to roll out later in 2015. Other simulations may be incorporated in the future.

This web project began as a project for a computer architecture class at Texas State University in San Marcos.

This web project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
