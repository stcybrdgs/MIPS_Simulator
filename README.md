MIPS Ops is a JavaScript web application that is meant to help MIPS newcomers to conceptualize the algorithms
that MIPS uses to accomplish certain functions. At the time of this writing, the application includes a simulation of
how MIPS handles integer multiplication. An additional simulation for integer division is currently in the works.
Other simulations may be incorporated thereafter.

This web project uses JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
